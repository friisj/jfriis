# Trux

> Side-scrolling monster truck survival game - A monochrome reimagining of Excite Bike

## Status

- **Phase:** Prototype
- **Temperature:** Warm
- **Started:** 2025-12-27

## Overview

Trux is a browser-based side-scrolling game where players pilot a parametrically customizable monster truck through procedurally generated terrain. Inspired by Excite Bike's physics-based gameplay, Trux emphasizes vehicle tuning and survival time over racing.

## Key Features

- **Monochrome line art aesthetic** - Clean, performant rendering
- **Procedural terrain generation** - Infinite, algorithm-driven levels
- **Parametric vehicle customization** - Adjust wheel diameter, suspension, weight, power
- **Physics-based gameplay** - Realistic momentum, gravity, collision
- **Survival scoring** - How long can you keep the truck upright?

## Project Structure

### Code
- `/components/studio/trux/` - Game components and engine

### Documentation
- `/docs/studio/trux/prototype/game-design.md` - Mechanics, controls, scoring
- `/docs/studio/trux/prototype/technical-spec.md` - Implementation details
- `/docs/studio/trux/prototype/implementation-notes.md` - Decisions and learnings

## Technology Stack

- **Canvas API** - 2D rendering
- **React** - UI and game loop management
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe game logic
- **Procedural generation** - Noise functions for terrain

## Next Steps

1. Create game design specification
2. Define vehicle physics model
3. Implement terrain generator
4. Build basic rendering engine
5. Add vehicle controls
6. Implement collision detection
7. Add parametric customization UI
8. Polish and tune

## Demo Goal

Playable prototype showcasing:
- Smooth side-scrolling physics
- Responsive vehicle controls
- Interesting procedural terrain
- Satisfying customization → gameplay feedback loop
